# AutoPricePrediction
Objective:To Train the data on the given features to get a good accuracy score
And also to find relation between features and the price of the car
Here we use Linear Regression model to train the data and to predict the data
We perform outliere handling,scaling and categorical conversion steps in the dataset to make the data more accurate for Machine Learning
The model predcit a good accuracy score
As there is a chance of wrong prediction of accuracy score because of large number of features we use adj_r2 to predict the data
And also adj_r2 also give a good score
